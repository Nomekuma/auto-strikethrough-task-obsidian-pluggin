# AutoStrikethroughTasksPlugin

`AutoStrikethroughTasksPlugin` is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that automatically applies or removes strikethrough formatting to completed or incomplete tasks in your notes.

## Features

- **Automatic Strikethrough on Completed Tasks**: When you mark a task as complete (`- [x]`), the plugin automatically applies strikethrough (`~~`) to the task text.
- **Automatic Removal of Strikethrough on Incomplete Tasks**: If you uncheck a task (`- [ ]`) that has strikethrough, the plugin will automatically remove the strikethrough.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin files or clone this repository into your Obsidian plugins folder.
2. Open Obsidian and navigate to `Settings` > `Community Plugins` > `Installed Plugins`.
3. Find the `AutoStrikethroughTasksPlugin` in the list and toggle it on.

## Usage

Once the plugin is enabled:

1. Write tasks using standard Markdown task list syntax.
   - Example:
     ```markdown
     - [ ] Task to do
     - [x] Task completed
     ```
   
2. The plugin will automatically:
   - Add strikethrough to completed tasks:
     ```markdown
     - [x] ~~Task completed~~
     ```
   - Remove strikethrough from unchecked tasks:
     ```markdown
     - [ ] Task to do
     ```

## Development

### Building the Plugin

To build this plugin, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, then:

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm run build` to compile the plugin.

### Development Notes

- The plugin listens for changes in the editor and updates task formatting in real-time.
- The `onload()` method registers the event listener, and the `onunload()` method cleans up when the plugin is disabled.
